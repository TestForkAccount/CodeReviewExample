# CodeReviewExample {WIP}


## Fork this repository
When you fork a repository, you create a copy of a repository. So forking this project will give you your own version of it.

- Click on the small fork image on the top of this page
- Congratulations! You now have a copy of this repository on your own git account
- Open your new repository in a separate tab, we will be making some changes to this


## Add collaborators to forked project
- Go to the `Settings` tab
- Go to `Collaborators`
- Add your team members here


## Add collaborators to CODEOWNERS file
- Go to the `Code` tab
- Click on the CODEOWNERS file
- Add your team members on line 2 with the syntax @membername


## Add branch rules to forked project
- Go to the `Settings` tab
- Go to `Branches`
- Click on `Add rule`
- Write "master" as 'Branch name pattern' 
- Check the 'Require pull request reviews before merging'

## Clone repository to your local machine
- Go to the `Code` tab
- Click on the 'Clone or download' button
- Grab the url
- Git clone the project by opening git bash where you want to clone the project, and type in `git clone https://github.com/YOUR-USERNAME/CodeReviewExample.git
- If you are using a GIT UI like `Github Desktop` you can clone directly from that program.

You now have the project working locally on your machine. Now we can make changes to the code.

When making changes to code, you should always branch out and create changes on that branch.
